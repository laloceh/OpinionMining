S8+. got tired using tall phone. wanted phone that's wider that. S8+ Moto X4 width. much easier use Moto one handed. performance phone actually faster day day use S8+ snapdragon 835. maybe editing video, takes tiny bit export video. Screen brightness good. Samsung higher notice inside use half brightness. speaker also earpiece same. quality really good loud. complain loud video others. wish feature amplifier sorts bring low sounds level speaker. Galaxy note 5 using S8+ almost 9 months. honestly tell miss thing. camera performance good. perhaps good S8+ downloaded Google Cam app camera better Sammy now. amazing software capable hardware. waste money expensive phones. got lesson. whole commerce business selling people every year new phone $250 phone actually $700 one. little slippery put Spigen case it. use going out. hesitate buy. fast screen crisp. cameras better Samsung S4 replaced me. trouble getting connected Page Plus (which uses Verizon Towers). Everything seems work. really like gesture system fingerprint reader. less good things. shaped textured like bar soap almost impossible hold without case. slippery, doubt would last week even careful hands without protective case. Compared Samsung S4 speaker tinny loud. max volume audio quality degrades lot. Also, compared S4 OLED screen reading dark good. Black black. one sharpest normal LED screens I've seen, can't compare OLED. usually pay twice phone costs get OLED, that's really fair comparison. Really biggest negative speaker. seems like could lot better lot added cost. put that, great phone. regret buying it. Moto X Pure battery dying, choice replacing battery (for me, required pro) $100 buy new X4 Amazon $279. chose latter glad did. phone things would expect new phone running Android 8.0, amazing camera, and, importantly, fairly heavy use amazing battery life. overnight charge, go bed least 75% remaining charge...I doubt would go well second day. way, appreciate Amazon Apps -- I'm devoted Prime Customer read Kindle app books listen Amazon Music App daily. Amazon apps tucked quietly site bother me. opening ads intrusions life, saving $100 buying Prime edition good deal. First say MUST update phone latest patch level, post March 2018, previous versions bug simply connect data network. review Android 8.1 available, information might happen. latest patch, review, fixes data connection issue, sometimes lose LTE even 3G connectivity reason, fixed simply turning mobile data back on, hopefully remedied next patch. that's said, overall decent mid range phone solid mid range Snapdragon SoC. going play heavy games record 4k60 video, going lag normal apps like internet, media playback, shopping apps. 32GB storage/3GB RAM fairly standard fare mid-range market, upgrade 4GB RAM would nice. camera alright, takes decent pictures, focusing laser assisted incredibly slow, can't take snap quick picture. water resistant rated, also means user replaceable battery. sound surprisingly good single speaker, though nothing special. something lot good mid range phones like Nokia 6.1 cannot do, that's connect Verizon's CDMA network, especially important use Tracfone owned carrier (Tracfone, Net10, Straight Talk) Verizon allows VoLTE service network whereas AT&T not. user interface general usability, fan Motorola's launcher, that's easily fixed multiple free launchers Google Play store. Contacts Phone app straight Google, meaning lacking terms quality life features able assign different notification sounds different contacts. Increasing ringtone, "feature" starts ringtone low increases it, hardcoded Motorola ROM unable disabled. notification light found many phones also present phone, also hardcoded Motorola ROM disabled. decent phone price, nothing overly special, third price Galaxy iPhone, tough argue. moved phone iPhone 6S, disappointed. Moto X4 everything need phone slightly bigger sharper screen. camera quite adequate - never intended use artwork but, event, notice quality photos worse iPhone's. know there's much whining unable remove Amazon ads: there's widget one screen page. bother. annoyances inherent figuring Android, apart glitches, usual apps working expected.
